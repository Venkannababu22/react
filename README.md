 - Dev Build
 - Local Server
 - HMR - Hot Module Replacement (refreshing the page automaticaaly when changes are made to the site)
 - File Watching Algorithm (written in c++)
 - Cache: Faster builds (when we installed parcel, a folder was created called .parcel-cache). Every time we made some changes it is caching those and when we build again, it builds in less time.
 - Image optimization
 - Minification of files
 - Bundling
 - Compress the files (smaller versions of code)
 - Differential bundling : supports for all the older version too
 - Consistent Hashing
 - Error handling
